--LONDON BICYCLE HIRES
--Here I queried open data on BigQuery about the use of bikes hires in London to answer questions about trip durations and locations.

--How many biketrips lasted for 20. minutes or longer?
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS num_of_biketrips
FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`
WHERE duration >= 1200;

--What are the names of the stations that bike_id 1710 started from?
SELECT 
DISTINCT start_station_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`
WHERE bike_id = 1710;

-- How many bike_ids have ended at 'Moor Street,Soho'
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT bike_id) AS num_of_bikes
FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`
WHERE end_station_name = 'Moor Street, Soho';

-- What is the station_id from 'Canton Street, Poplar'
SELECT 
  DISTINCT start_station_id
FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`
WHERE start_station_name = 'Canton Street, Poplar';

-- What is the name of the station whose ID is 111?
SELECT 
  DISTINCT start_station_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`
WHERE start_station_id = 111;

-- How many distinct bike_ids had trip durations great than 2400 seconds (40 minutes)?
SELECT
  COUNT (DISTINCT bike_id) AS num_of_trips
FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`
WHERE duration >= 2400;

-- Which station did thre renter ID 57635395 end?
SELECT
  end_station_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`
WHERE
  rental_id = 57635395;


-- NEW YORK BICYCLE HIRES
-- Here I was practicing using more complicated clauses and temporary tables in BigQuery

--With clauses
WITH trips_over_1_hr AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips
  WHERE
    tripduration >= 60
)

## Count how many trips are 60+ minutes long
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS CNT
FROM 
  trips_over_1_hr;

## Temporary Table - which bike has been used the most/longest minutes ridden
WITH longest_used_bike AS (
  SELECT 
    bike_id,
    SUM(duration_minutes) AS trip_duration
FROM
  bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips
GROUP BY
  bike_id
ORDER BY
  trip_duration DESC
  LIMIT 1
)

## From which station does this bike start most frequently

SELECT
  trips.start_station_id, 
  COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM 
  longest_used_bike AS longest
  INNER JOIN
    bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips AS trips
  ON 
    longest.bike_id = trips.bike_id
GROUP BY
  trips.start_station_id
ORDER BY
  trip_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
